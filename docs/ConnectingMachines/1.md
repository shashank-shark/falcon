# Being a part of the network

Let's assume there is already a bunch of computers connected to a local network.

Refer to the figure given below. Three nodes / computers are connected to a `local area network` via `ROUTER`. These three machines are having their own `IP` address which makes them to be uniquely identified within the local area network or `subnet`.

Machine with IP address `192.168.43.1` can communicate to other two machines having IP address `192.168.43.2` and `192.168.43.3`.

You can check this via a `ping` command. Just make sure these nodes are connected within the local network and issue the command `ping [IP ADDDRESS]`.

So being a part of a network makes a machine to communicate to other machines present within the same network and also provides us the flexibility to send and retrieve data from different machines.
